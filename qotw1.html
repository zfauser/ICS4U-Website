  <h1>Question Of The Week: Safer Internet Day</h1>
  <p>
    This year, Safer Internet Day was on February 6th. The goal of this day is to raise awareness about the importance of staying safe online. Safer internet day was originally an initiative started by the European Union, but it has since grown to be celebrated in over 180 countries. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In honor of this day, I wanted to share some tips on how to stay safe online:
    <ol>
      <li>Use a password manager</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Using a password manager is a very important aspect of safe internet use. A password manager is a tool that stores all of your passwords in one place. The reason why this is important is that it helps you more easily use a different password on every site, which is extremely important. This is because if a hacker gets ahold of one of your passwords, they could potentially have access to all of your accounts. Using a password manager can help prevent this from happening as it is able to generate and store complex passwords for you, so if one account gets compromised, the hacker will not be able to access your other accounts.</li>
            <li>
              There are many different password managers out there, but some of the most popular ones include <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" target="_blank">Lastpass</a>, <a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank">1Password</a>, and <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/" target="_blank">Dashlane</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Personally, I use Lastpass and have found it to be very helpful and find is very useful in keeping my accounts safe and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a password manager.
            </li>
            <li>
              Here is a video with additional information on the importance of password managers:

            </li>
          </ul>
      <li>Use an Anti Virus</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Using an antivirus is another important step in keeping yourself safe on the internet. Even if you are careful online, it is still possible to get a virus on your computer. For example, an application that you have previously installed could have a vulnerability that a hacker could exploit. An antivirus can help prevent this from happening by scanning your computer for known viruses and malware as well as detecting malicious actions by applications that have been compromised. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Some of the popular antivirus programs are <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/?csrc=vanity" target="_blank">McAfee</a>, <a href="https://ca.norton.com/?lsModal=1">Norton</a>, and <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/">Bitdefender</a>. However, if you are using a Windows computer, you may aleraedy have Microsoft Defender installed, which is a free antivirus that comes with Windows. You are also able to use Microsoft Defender on your Mac and on your Phone if you have a Microsoft 365 subscription. You can find more information about Microsoft Defender <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-defender-for-individuals?ranMID=24542&ranEAID=nOD/rLJHOac&ranSiteID=nOD_rLJHOac-IP0I3SgQq3IWmCKr6E7v8g&epi=nOD_rLJHOac-IP0I3SgQq3IWmCKr6E7v8g&irgwc=1&OCID=AID2200057_aff_7593_1243925&tduid=%28ir__lfr3gky6z0kf6gakw3uygvphcu2xvp1fkph0qx1z00%29%287593%29%281243925%29%28nOD_rLJHOac-IP0I3SgQq3IWmCKr6E7v8g%29%28%29">here.</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              Personally, I use Microsoft Defender on my Mac and have not have any issues with it. If you alerady have a Microsoft 365 subscription, I would recommend it.
            </li>
          </ul>
      <li>Use an RFID blocking wallet</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              While not really internet safety, some say it is important to use an RFID blocking wallet. The reason why this is important in that the technology that allows you to tap your card to pay, RFID, could be exploited by a hacker by using an RFID reader to duplicate your card. An RFID blocking wallet is able to stop this by blocking the signals from your card.
            </li>
            <li>
              This issue has also been disputed however, for example in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/rfid-blocking-wallets/" target="_black">2017 New York Times article</a>, the author said that while there is no harm in using an RFID wallet for piece of mind, RFID theft is not a large threat. In a <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/are-rfid-blocking-products-worth-your-money-we-asked-an-expert/">2019 article by digitaltrends</a>, Roger Grimes of <a href="https://www.knowbe4.com/about-us/">KnowBe4</a>, a company that provides security awareness training, "You shouldn't spend one cent. There has still to this day not been a report of a single real-world crime that an RFID blocking product would have stopped."
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are still intrested in getting an RFID blocking wallet for piece of mind here popular options are the <a href="https://ridgewallet.ca/collections/wallets">The Ridge Wallet</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=VULKIT">Vulkit</a>. You can also get RFID blocking cards to put in your existing wallet, like this <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/TICONN-Blocking-Contactless-Protector-Perfectly/dp/B07T8PYBKM/ref=sr_1_6?crid=16UXSCRKA53AO&keywords=rfid+blocking+card&qid=1707487307&sprefix=rfid+blocking+car%2Caps%2C116&sr=8-6">one.</a> 
            </li>
            <li>
              I personally do have an RFID blocking wallet, but with the new information I have found, I am not sure if I would specifically seek one out.
            </li>
          </ul>
      <li>Don't overshare online</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It is important be cautios about what you share on the internet.
            </li>
          </ul>
      <li>Update your software</li>
          <ul>
            <li>It is important to esnure that the software and operating system remain up-to-date on your computer.</li>
            <li>
              Here is a video with additional information on the importance of updating your software:

            </li>
          </ul>
      <li>Avoid the use of public WiFi</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Public WiFi is a dangerous place</li>
            <li>Here is a video with more information about what percautions should be taken when using public WiFi:

            </li>
          </ul>
      <li>Common sense</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Arguably the most important part of staying safe online is to use common sense.
