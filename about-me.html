  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi there, my name is Zach! I am a grade 12 student that goes to South
    Carleton High School. I enjoy many different aspects of technology. My
    favourite programming language is JavaScript. Next year, I hope to go to
    university for Computer Science.
    <br />
    <br />
    Outside of school, I enjoy exploring many different areas of information technology, like the cloud,
    specifically Azure and Oracle Cloud. I also enjoy playing around in Linux
    and programming.
    <br />
    <br />
    During the summer, I worked at the Bank of Canada in the IT department.
    Specifically, I helped to deploy some of their new computers, which helped
    me to learn a lot about different aspects of device management using the
    Microsoft Intune tool.
