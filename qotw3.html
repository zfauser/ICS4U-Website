    <ul>
      <li>On April 28th, the Ontario government banned cell phones in class, despite the fact that another cell phone ban was already implemented in 2019. This poses the question of why we need a cell phone ban in the first place, let alone two bans. However before getting into that question, let's first look at what the ban actually does:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>It completely bans cell phones for the <b>entire school day</b> for Grade 6 students and below, unless a teacher allows for it to be used</li>
        <li>It bans cell phones for Grade 7 students and above <b>during class time</b>, unless a teacher allows for it to be used</li>
        <br>
        <li>If a student's cell phone is seen by a teacher it will be:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Taken away for the <b>rest of the day</b> if the student in Grade 6 or below</li>
          <li>Taken away for the <b>rest of class</b> if the student is in Grade 7 or above</li>
          <li>If a student does not hand over their device, they will have to go to the principals office</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      <li>This will be done be requiring schools to put a policy in place in order to enforce these new rules</li>
      <br>
      <li>Education Minister Stephen Lecce says that this ban will be more effective then the previous ban in 2019 as it will be more consistent in enforcing the rules across all of Ontario</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <li>Now let's answer some of the questions you might have about this ban:</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Why is the reasoning behind this ban?</b></li>
    </ol>
