        <li>Crypto currencies, like Bitcoin, have become more and more prevalent in online scams. One scam that is becoming more and more common are fake cryptocurrency investing platforms. The way this scam works is that a scammer creates an app that appears to be a legitimate investing platform, which convinces victims to put money on the website, and then the website <i>appears</i> to actually generate a return on your money, heck, it may even allow you to withdraw some of it, but this is all done in order to convince the user to put more and more money on the website, until the victim eventually realizes the whole thing was a scam. Often times victims are convinced to put money on these platforms by deepfake videos of celebrities like Elon Musk. Below is a <b><u><i>deepfake video</i></u></b> of multiple celebrities promoting a fake crypto casino. Think about whether or not you would fall for it!</li>

      <li>Spear Phishing</li>

        <li>Spear phishing is a special type of phishing attack that specifically targets one person. For example instead of sending a mass phishing email with generic aspects like referring to you as 'user' or simply using just some of your basic information like your first and last name, a scammer may perform more in depth research on a particular person and may use additional information that they have collected from additional people close you, possibly from other phishing attacks to trick you.</li>
