    <li>Internet scams are more and more common and can be tricky to spot if you are unaware of the techniques used by

      <li>Crypto currencies, like Bitcoin, have become more and more prevalent in online scams. One scam that is
        becoming more and more common are fake cryptocurrency investing platforms. The way this scam works is that a
        scammer creates an app that appears to be a legitimate investing platform, which convinces victims to put money
        on the website, and then the website <i>appears</i> to actually generate a return on your money, heck, it may
        even allow you to withdraw some of it, but this is all done in order to convince the user to put more and more
        money on the website, until the victim eventually realizes the whole thing was a scam. Often times victims are
        convinced to put money on these platforms by <abbr

      <li>Spear phishing is a special type of phishing attack that specifically sets out to trick a particular person or
        group. For example instead of sending a mass phishing email with generic aspects like referring to you as 'user'
        or simply using just some of your basic information like your first and last name, a scammer may perform more in
        depth research on a particular person and may use additional information that they have obtained in various
        ways, such as an attack on the company you work, by performing attacks on people close to you, or just by using
        the the internet to find your info.</li>
      <li>
        To see just how devastating this type of attack can be, lets go back to February and look at a finance employee
        in Hong Kong who paid out over $25 Million American dollars to someone who had tricked them with spear phishing
        techniques. The victim was initially suspicious that an email they had received was a phishing attempt, but he
        was tricked when he joined a video call with the scammer, who was using a deepfake of the CFO. The victim was
        then convinced and sent $200 million Hong Kong Dollars which is about $25.6 Million American dollars. If you
        would like, you can read more about this story <a

      <li>
        Romance scams are when somebody pretends to be interested in you romantically in order to trick you into giving
        them money. This happens in many ways, you may find someone on a dating app that seems interested in you, and
        they build up a relationship with you over time, but eventually, they will find a way to ask for money from you.
        One way they may do this, which is detailed in <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254340">The Tinder
          Swindler on Netflix</a>, is by really building up a relationship with you, including meeting you in person,
        but then, they will trick you into thinking something bad happened to them, like being injured, and will ask you
        for money in order to help them out. Another technique scammers use is to attempt to get you to send explicit
        photos of yourself, and then they will threaten to send them to your friends and family if you don't send them
        money.

        in another scam that the scammer was running.

      <li>
        Job scams are when someone offers you a job that seems too good to be true, and it is. One way this scam works
        is that a scammer will offer you a job that pays a lot of money for very little work, and then they will ask you
        to pay them a fee in order to get the job. Another way this scam works is that the scammer will offer you a job
        and then send you a large check which the scammer says is to buy supplies for the job, After you deposit the
        check and buy the items that they tell you to buy, you will have left over money that you will send back to the
        scammer. The check will eventually bounce, and you will be out the money that you sent to the scammer.

      <li>
        Service scams are when someone offers you a service in a manipulative way in order to trick you out of your
        money. One type of service scam, which is detailed in the video below, is where local Facebook groups will be
        flooded with posts for air duct cleaning services, but there is a middle man involved meaning that you are
        unaware of the quality of service you will receive. They could be a reliable cleaner or just a random guy
        blowing air into your ducts, as detailed in a <a href="https://pressreader.com/article/281934540328214">2013
          Ottawa Citizen article.</a>
      </li>

        allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <li>
        There is another version of this scam where the scammer will have you pay for the air duct cleaning service in
        advanced, but then they will never show up to clean your air ducts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another popular service scam is the refund scam. In this scam, the scammer will call you and tell you that you
        are owed a refund for a service that you have paid for, but they will pretend to give you too much money and ask
        you to send the extra money back to them. This is often done by remotely connecting to your computer and showing
        you a fake refund screen, and then they will ask you to send the extra money back to them. This can be seen in
        the video below.

      <p>In my opinion, the best way to protect yourself from scams is to stay up-to-date with the newest tactics that
        these criminals are using commit fraud. It is also important to let other people know about new scams that you
        learn about so that they can also stay protected. Beyond what you have already learned here, you can learn more
        about some of more recent scams in the following video:</p>
